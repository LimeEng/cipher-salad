# Cipher salad

Cipher salad aspires to be a diverse selection of classic ciphers.

Currently, only three ciphers are implemented.

- [Atbash cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash)
- [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- [Vigen√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
